# 🎯 **Ads CTR Optimizer using Reinforcement Learning** 📊  

This project implements an **Ads Click-Through Rate (CTR) Optimization System** from scratch using **Reinforcement Learning**. By leveraging the **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)** algorithm, this model dynamically selects the most effective advertisement to display based on user feedback. The system aims to maximize engagement by learning from rewards (clicks) and penalties (no clicks) provided by users.  

---

## 🌟 **Project Aim**  

The goal is to optimize the selection of ads to display to users by determining which ad is most likely to receive a click. This project simulates a **decision-making system** where the algorithm learns and adapts over time to maximize the overall click-through rate.  

This approach can revolutionize advertising strategies by ensuring higher engagement and better user experience while minimizing wasted impressions.

## 📂 **Project Workflow**  

### **1. Dataset Preparation**  
- Simulated data was used to represent user feedback on ads.  
- Each row in the dataset corresponds to a user's interaction with various ads, where feedback is either:  
  - **1 (Reward)**: The ad was clicked.  
  - **0 (Punishment)**: The ad was ignored.  

### **2. Problem Formulation**  
- The project is modeled as a **multi-armed bandit problem**, where each ad represents an arm.  
- The algorithm needs to decide which ad to display to maximize rewards over time.  

### **3. Implementation of UCB Algorithm**  
- **Upper Confidence Bound (UCB)** was implemented to solve the problem.  
- Key steps include:  
  - **Initialization**: Start with no prior knowledge of ad performance.  
  - **Ad Selection**: Use the UCB formula to calculate the upper bound for each ad.  
  - **Feedback Update**: Update reward and penalty counts for the selected ad based on user interaction.  

### **4. Evaluation**  
- The performance of the UCB algorithm was evaluated by:  
  - Tracking the total rewards (number of clicks).  
  - Comparing the effectiveness of different ads over time.  

### **5. Visualization**  
- **Matplotlib** was used to visualize:  
  - The total rewards accumulated over time.  
  - The selection frequency of each ad.
